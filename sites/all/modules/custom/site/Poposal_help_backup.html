      <h3>Making a Proposal – Introduction</h3>
      <div class="proposal-popup-highlight">Thank you for your interest in making a proposal and helping us to solve the standards challenges that face government today.</div>
      <p>We have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to submit a proposal to the Standards Hub. However making a really useful proposal – one that can be taken forward into real standards development work – inevitably requires a little thought.</p>
      <p>We want your proposal to be successful, so the next few screens help to explain what we are looking for in a really good proposal.</p>
      <div class="proposal-popup-highlight">Note that you can save a draft of your proposal at any time and come back to do more work on it later.</div>
    </div>

      <h3>Making a Proposal – Essentials</h3>
      There are just three essential boxes to complete when you make a proposal:
      <div class="proposal-filed-description"><strong>Title</strong> - A short title to summarise your proposal
        <div class="proposal-popup-tips"><span>Tips</span>
          <ul>
            <li>This is what will be shown in on-screen listings, so try to make it as concise and meaningful as possible</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="proposal-filed-description"><strong>What</strong> – What is it that you are proposing? For example, how could new or existing standards be applied to this scenario?
        <div class="proposal-popup-tips"><span>Tips</span>
          <ul>
            <li>Take time to describe your idea as precisely and completely as possible. Remember that this needs to make sense to a wide range of readers, some of whom who may not be as familiar with the subject area as you are</li>
            <li>Make sure that there is a clear link between your proposal and the challenge that it answers</li>
            <li>Feel free to provide references to supporting materials or specifications which provide more details</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="proposal-filed-description"><strong>Why</strong> – Why is this important; what benefits do you foresee?
        <div class="proposal-popup-tips"><span>Tips</span>
          <ul>
            <li>Don’t worry if you don’t have all the answers here – as we can help to develop a full rationale for really good ideas later. However the more information you can provide up-front, the easier it will be for your proposal to be accepted</li>
            <li>Try to support your arguments with sources and evidence where possible</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Making a Proposal – Additional Information</h3>
      Once you have completed the essentials, there are two optional areas where
      you may choose to tell us more:
      <div class="proposal-filed-description"><strong>When</strong> – Is there a date when this solution needs to be in place?
        <div class="proposal-popup-tips"><span>Tips</span>
          <ul>
            <li>If you provide a date then please also explain why it is important</li>
            <li>It’s fine to leave this section blank if there is no specific date or if it is just needed “as soon as possible”</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="proposal-filed-description"><strong>How</strong> – Is there a project or group which can take this forwards?
        <div class="proposal-popup-tips"><span>Tips</span>
          <ul><li>Don’t worry if you don’t have an answer to this. Just leave this section blank, as we can help find someone to work on your idea. However if you do already have a view on who may be able to do this work then clearly this makes your proposal easier to progress</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Making a Proposal – What happens next?</h3>
      <p>Once you have submitted your proposal then it will appear on the website for other users to read. They may make comments about it – and you might want to respond.</p>
      <p>Proposals will accumulate against each Challenge until the Challenge End Date is reached. At this point an expert Standards Panel will meet to review each proposal. You may be contacted for more information, and you can expect to get some feedback about whether your proposal has been accepted for further development.</p>
      <p>Proposals which are accepted will move forwards into the <a href="#">Standards Pipeline</a>.
        This is where further effort is focused on the successful proposals, to develop them into full standards profiles for use across government.</p>
      <p>If you are interested then you can read more <a href="#">here</a> about how the process works.</p>
      <div class="proposal-popup-highlight">
        You can use the “Track Progress” menu option at any time to follow the activity and keep track of how your proposal is getting on
